## Backend Setup

-   Change the directory to the `server` subproject by running `cd server`.
-   (1) rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the values or use the defaul ones.
-   (2) Install the backend dependencies by running `npm install` in the `server` subproject.
-   (3) Run the backend server by running `npm run start:dev` in the `server` subproject.
-   (4) At this point you should be able to access the backend server at http://localhost:4000/graphql

## Frontend Setup

-   Change the directory to the `client` subproject by running `cd client`.
-   (1) rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the values or use the defaul ones.
